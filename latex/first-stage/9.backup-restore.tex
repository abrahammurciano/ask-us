\subsection{Backup and Restore}

To test that the data is all in place, we are tasked with creating backups of all the data, then deleting all the data from the database and finally importing it all again.

The exported backup files can be found in the directory \verb`/sql/backup/`, as well as the script which we use to delete all the data, which is called \verb`delete_all.sql`.
