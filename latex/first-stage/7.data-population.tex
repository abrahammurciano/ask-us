\section{Populating Tables With Data}

Now that we have successfully created all the necessary data, it is time to fill them with data. We will use a variety of different methods to import data to our tables.

\subsection{Populating Users}

We retrieved a large excel file containing over one hundred thousand users' data from the internet, and using the PL/SQL Developer tool called ODBC importer we imported the data which we needed into the users table. Not all of the columns provided were necessary to us, so figure \ref{users-odbc} shows which columns we used. The excel file which we used can be found in \verb`/data/users/user_list.xlsx`.

	\caption{A screenshot showing how the ODBC importer imported our data}
	\label{users-odbc}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Populating Posts}

Since this table only contains one column, and that column's value was always generated by the database, this simple script was enough to insert the required number of post IDs into the post table.

\subsection{Populating Questions}

We were able to obtain a CSV file containing all of the questions which were asked on \LaTeX\ Stack Exchange between January 2010 and September 2020. After appending an ID from those which we inserted into the \verb`posts` table to each row, and removing all columns which we do not need, we ran the text importer tool in PL/SQL Developer to add all of the data in the CSV file into the \verb`questions` table.

Figure \ref{questions-text-import} shows the configurations for the text importer which was used to import the questions from our CSV file.

\subsection{Populating Topics}

We were able to find a large list with 1,547 topics which Quora uses to organise their questions. We obtained it in the form of a plain text file with one line for each topic name. Since it contains duplicates, we can must first remove these. Then we generate some randomised description using the python module called \verb`lorem`. This python code shows exactly how the insert statements were generated. The generated SQL code can be found at \verb`/sql/insert/topics.sql`

\subsection{Populating Follows}

This table was populated using the text importer tool in PL/SQL Developer. We asked the system to generate a number from the users' ID column for the foreign key to that row, and similar for the other foreign key. Figure \ref{follows-generator} shows the settings we used to generate 600,000 rows.
