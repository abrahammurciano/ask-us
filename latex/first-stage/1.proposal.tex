\subsection{Proposal}

Ask Us is a hypothetical organization who want to create a website where people can ask and answer questions to the general public on any topic. Our task is to analyse the data needs of such a website, to the ends of creating a database for them along with a website to interface with it.

Ask Us will need to store information on its users, as well as all the questions and answers. They would also like each question and answer to have its own comment thread, for people to contribute helpful information regarding answers as well as for short follow up questions.

All questions, answers, and comments should be scored by the users in some way, so that people can see what posts were considered good by the general public and which were disliked. This should help people evaluate the answers and comments they receive.

Additionally, they would like questions to be organized by topic, where each question can be associated with multiple topics. Users should also be able to follow topics they are interested in, so they can see questions related to their interests.
