\section{Entity Relationship Diagram}
\subsection{Entities}
We will have seven entities: user, post, Q\&A post, question, answer, comment, and topic.

A user is any individual writing a post on Ask Us. The user entity will have five attributes: ID, name, email, password, and points. A user's points are the sum of all the points of all their posts. ID will be the primary key.

A post is anything a user writes. This can either be a question, answer, or comment. The post entity wil have four attributes: ID, body, date-time, and points. Here, points is the number of points that have been awarded to any specific post. ID is the primary key.

A Q\&A post is either a question or an answer that a user posts. The Q\&A post entity has no attributes of its own, since it is a weak entity. Its primary key is the post's ID.

A question is what a user would post if he wanted to receive a solution to his inquiry. The question entity has one attribute called title, as well as the attributes it `inherits' from post. Since it is a weak entity, its primary key is the post's ID.

An answer is what a user would post if he wanted to give a solution to a question. The answer entity has a boolean attribute called accepted. Other than that, all the rest of the attributes are `inherited' from post.

A comment is a type of post, and is typically a short piece of text that a user writes beneath any other post. A comment itself has no attributes. Since it is a weak entity, its primary key is the post's ID.

A topic is a way for users to categorize their questions, thus getting better targeted responses. A user can also follow a topic of interest. The topic entity will have three attributes: ID, name, and description. ID will once again be the primary key.
