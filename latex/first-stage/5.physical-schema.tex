\section{Physical Schema}

Here we can see the SQL statements which can be used to create the tables we defined above. These statements are specific to Oracle Database.

\subsection{Users Table}

Displayed here is the SQL statement that creates the users table. An 8 digit number for the ID (and all ID fields of subsequent tables) is large enough since we will not have more than one million records in the entire database. The ID field is to be generated by the database.

Usernames we limit to twenty characters, and email addresses to 320. This is because 320 characters is the length of the longest possible email address. The password field will actually store a base 64 encoded SHA256 hash of the password, which takes 44 bytes.

A reasonable cap for the total number of points a user can accumulate is a ten digit number. This conclusion is based off researching the highest number of points any user has ever accumulated on popular websites which implement similar scoring systems, then adding a couple of digits to be on the safe side. By default, a user starts with no points.
