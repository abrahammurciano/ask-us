\subsection{Functional Dependencies}
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{User} table.
\[\text{ID} \to \text{(Name, Email, Password, Points)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Topic} table.
\[\text{ID} \to \text{(Name, Description)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Post} table.
\[\text{ID} \to \text{(DateTime, Body, Points, Author User ID)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Comment} table.
\[\text{Post ID} \to \text{(Parent Post ID)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Question} table.
\[\text{Post ID} \to \text{(Title)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Answer} table.
\[\text{Post ID} \to \text{(Accepted, Question ID)}\]
The tables for \textsc{Follows} and \textsc{Relates} to have no functional dependencies.


\subsection{Third Normal Form}
All the tables above are in 3NF because all the functional dependencies of the form \(X \to Y\) satisfiy the condition ``\(X\) is a superkey''.

The tables for \textsc{Follows} and \textsc{Relates} to are also in 3NF since they have no functional dependencies.

For the same reason, the tables are all in BCNF.
