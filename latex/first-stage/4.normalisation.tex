\subsection{Normalization}
\subsubsection{Functional Dependencies}
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{User} table.
\begin{gather*}
	\text{ID} \to \text{(Name, Email, Password, Points)} \\
	\text{Email} \to \text{(ID, Name, Password, Points)}
\end{gather*}
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Topic} table.
\[\text{ID} \to \text{(Name, Description)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Comment} table.
\[\text{Post ID} \to \text{(Parent Post ID, Body, Points, TimeStamp)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Question} table.
\[\text{Post ID} \to \text{(Title, Body, Points, TimeStamp)}\]
These are the functional dependencies for the \textsc{Answer} table.
\[\text{Post ID} \to \text{(Accepted, Question ID, Body, Points, TimeStamp)}\]
The tables for \textsc{Post}, \textsc{Follows}, \textsc{Relates to} and \textsc{Vote} have no non trivial functional dependencies.


\subsubsection{Third Normal Form}
All the tables above are in 3NF because all the functional dependencies of the form \(X \to Y\) satisfiy the condition ``\(X\) is a superkey''.

The tables for \textsc{Post}, \textsc{Follows}, \textsc{Relates to} and \textsc{Vote} to are also in 3NF since they have no non-trivial functional dependencies.

For the same reason, the tables are all in BCNF.
