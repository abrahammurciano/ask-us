\subsection{Extending SQL}

This stage is about using PL/SQL to extend the SQL we have used so far. We have two tasks for this section. Firstly, we must write a script that uses PL/SQL and demonstrates a cursor loop, and before and after triggers.

First of all, our script uses a cursor loop to display all the topics that each user follows.

Then our script uses before insert and update triggers to store the given password as the base 64 encoded SHA256 hash, rather than as the given plain text.
