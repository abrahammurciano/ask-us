In the fourth stage we must create an application which will access the database. We considered creating a web based application, but decided that due to time constraints, a command line application would be more manageable.

We have created one using Python, which can be found in the directory \verb`/app`. Since we were unable to connect to the Oracle database remotely, we had to port over the database to another DBMS. We chose SQLite3 for this, since it is by far the easiest to set up. The database can also be found in the same directory.
