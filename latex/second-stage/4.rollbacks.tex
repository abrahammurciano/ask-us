\subsection{Rollbacks}

We are to write an SQL script which selects a subset of the data from one of our tables, then updates and displays the updated records. Then the script should perform a rollback and display the results of the query again.

We have written a script, which is shown below, which selects all the users who have a username starting with the letter A. Thirty records were found which satisfy this condition. Then the script changes their email address to end in `@aol.com'.
